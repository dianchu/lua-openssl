	Corona depends on luasocket.
	luasocket has an auxiliar.c and auxiliar.h.
	lua-openssl also has its own auxiliar.c and auxiliar.h.
	This caused a duplicate symbol link error.
	Our solution was to remove the auxiliar.c and auxiliar.h in lua-openssl,
	then add back the differences as corona_auxiliar.c/corona_auxiliar.h.
